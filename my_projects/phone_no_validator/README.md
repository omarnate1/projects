# Phone Number Validator Project

This project is a simple Phone Number Validator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its primary purpose is to validate phone numbers entered by users based on predefined criteria.

## User Stories

   - When the user clicks on the `Validate` button without entering a phone number in the input field, the application should prompt with an alert saying "Please input a phone number."

2. **Valid Phone Numbers:**

   - When a valid phone number is entered and the `Validate` button is clicked, the application should provide instant feedback indicating that the phone number is valid.

3. **Invalid Phone Numbers:**
   - When an invalid phone number is entered and the `Validate` button is clicked, the application should display an error message indicating that the phone number is invalid.
