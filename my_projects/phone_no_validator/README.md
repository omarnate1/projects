# Phone Number Validator Project

This project is a simple Phone Number Validator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to validate phone numbers entered by users based on certain criteria.

## Features

- Validates phone numbers entered by users.
- Provides instant feedback on whether the entered phone number is valid or not.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS**: Adds styles and enhances the visual appeal of the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the functionality of the phone number validation.

## Usage

To use the Phone Number Validator:

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in your web browser.
2. Enter the phone number you wish to validate in the designated input field.
3. Press the "Validate" button.
4. Receive instant feedback indicating whether the entered phone number is valid or not.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling the HTML elements.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that implements the phone number validation logic.

## How It Works

The Phone Number Validator project employs JavaScript to validate phone numbers. It checks the entered phone number against predefined criteria, such as length, format, and character types.

Upon clicking the "Validate" button, the JavaScript function is triggered, which validates the entered phone number according to the specified criteria. If the phone number meets the criteria, a success message is displayed to the user indicating that the phone number is valid. Otherwise, an error message notifies the user that the entered phone number is invalid.
